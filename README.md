Leveraged logistic regression as well as SVC modeling on different sample sizes as well as with an iterative process in balancing weights to identify a song as likely to be enjoyed or not by a user. Sample playlists used for modeling were set up using the Spotify API in accordance with a "Liked Songs" playlist pulled from my main spotify library as well as a "Disliked Songs" playlist pulled from 50 songs I strongly dislike.
